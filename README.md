This project is by Alexander Chatron-Michaud, Cait Armstrong, Keith Strickling

For grading purposes, the material you may be looking for can be found in the following classes:
	classifiers.py : Here you'll find the algorithms we used for Lin Reg, Log Reg, and NB, main part of the code
	cross_validation.py : Here you'll find the methods for k fold cross validation and cross validation across multiple models with different dimension expansions
	run.py : Probably the most messy, you can run this script to generate the data as the file PREDICTIONS.csv
