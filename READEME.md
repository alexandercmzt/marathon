This project is by Alexander Chatron-Michaud, Cait Armstrong, Keith Strickling

For grading purposes, the material can be found in the following classes:
	classifiers.py : Here you'll find the algorithms we used for Lin Reg, Log Reg, and NB
	cross_validation.py : Here you'll find the methods for k fold cross validation and cross validation across multiple models with different dimension expansions
	run.py : Probably the most messy and least interesting, you can run this script with flag -lin , -log , or -nb to get data
